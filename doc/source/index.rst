Gain Calculator
===============

Welcome to the documentation of GainCalculator. It is a simple Python package serving as a wrapper around
`Flexible atomic code <https://github.com/flexible-atomic-code/fac>`_ and
`RAY library <https://github.com/ray-project/ray>`_. It is highly recommended that you see :ref:`getting-started` first.
You can also visit the :ref:`usage-examples` if that is what you are looking for. To get the full description of
all classes, methods and free functions see :ref:`API`.

All of previously mentioned pages are under the "FOR USERS" section. If you are a developer of GainCalculator or
you want to augment/change the code somehow or if you are just curious see the :ref:`developer-api`.
